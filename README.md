# Multi-Threaded Web Server in Rust

All hail to the Rust, and I thought what could be more fun than making a project with it.

Always wanted to take a look at how servers work and dig deeper into backend development.

It's been a hell of a ride, although I still struggle with many of the concepts in it.

Have fun using this code! NO LICENSE! NO LLM ALLOWED(F! U GPT)!
